# Horatio

## Introduction

Horatio is a library of patterns, protocols, and classes typical for the "skeleton" of a modern app. This includes:

1. Operations queue with conditions, observers, and improved error handling (based on Apple’s "Advanced NSOperations" sample code).
2. HTTP requests for standard REST services.
3. An injection container.
4. A feature availability system for global or per-subject behaviors.

By implementing concrete implementations of various protocols, you can quickly implement complex, testable network apps.

Horatio relies on the Advanced NSOperations sample code from Apple.

<a id="requirements"></a> 
## 1. Requirements

Horatio is delivered as Swift 3.1 source files. Due to Swift’s current
lack of ABI-compatibility, there is no pre-compiled framework delivery
for it at the moment.

Horatio requires compilation against iOS SDK 9.0 or higher.

## 2. Setup

### 2.1 Download the source

1. Download the latest [MPA-Horatio](https://github.com/ktatroe/MPA-Network.git) framework, provided as source files.

### 2.2 Copy the SDK into your projects directory in Finder

Typically, 3rd-party libraries reside inside a folder in your Xcode
project (for example purposes, we assume your folder is called
"Vendor"). Create a folder and copy the SDK source files into it (the
Demo source files are not part of the main SDK, but could be copied into
your app as a starting point for various behaviors and patterns beyond
that which is provided by the SDK itself).

### 2.4 Add the SDK to the project in Xcode

> We recommend to use Xcode's group-feature to create a group for
> 3rd-party-libraries similar to the structure of our files on disk. For
> example, similar to the file structure in 2.2 above, our projects have
> a group called `Vendor`.
  
1. Make sure the `Project Navigator` is visible (⌘+1).
2. Drag & drop `Horatio.xcodeproj` from your `Finder` to the `Vendor` group in `Xcode` using the `Project Navigator` on the left side.

### 2.4 Modify Code 

1. Open your `AppDelegate.swift` file.
2. Search for the method 

  ```swift
  application(application: UIApplication, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions:[NSObject: AnyObject]?) -> Bool
  ```

4. Add the following lines to create a shared `Container` for use throughout your application:

  ```swift
  Container.register(OperationQueue.self) { _ in OperationQueue() }
  ```

In addition, register Services, Bridges, Feeds, etc. Typically, you'll
provide a startup manager class to handle the startup sequence.

Documentation for Horatio can be found on (TBD).

## 5.Troubleshooting

### iTunes Connect rejection

  Make sure none of the following files are added to any target:

  - `CalendarCondition.swift` (except if your app asks for permission to access the user’s calendar)
  - `CloudCondition.swift` (except if your app includes the CloudKit entitlement and at least one CloudKit container)
  - `HealthCondition.swift` (except if your app includes the HealthKit entitlement)
  - `PassbookCondition.swift` (except if your app uses Passbook API)
  - `PhotosCondition.swift` (except if your app asks for permission to access the user’s Photos data)
  - `UserNotificationCondition.swift` (except if your app includes the Push entitlement and has a valid APNS certificate for its bundle)

In the framework version of the project, these files are under the
Optional group, and are not compiled by default into the generated
framework.

## 8. Future Work

Horatio's roadmap is somewhat flexible, based on contributor's needs at any given point.
Currently, the following items are being tackled in experimental branches for inclusion
at a later date:

- Finishing the demo app, including documenting the app startup code.
- Moving the Startup Sequence feature into the framework.
- Moving the Environment/Config work into the framework.
- Adding stacks and updates to Features.
- Better pipelining of fetched files for faster and lower battery profile parsing.
- Rewritten operations system based on Javascript's Promises system.
